\subsection*{Where we started}
Our first sketches revolved around a ``dinner experiences'' marketplace that matched home chefs with curious guests. It fit the zeitgeist but clashed with why we joined the course. Early interviews and the VirtuAI quick-case debrief \citep{Gunasilan2024} exposed two red flags: regulators already scrutinise informal food businesses, and we had zero logistics advantage. Overlaying \citet{Choudary2016}'s typology made it obvious we were drifting toward an asset-heavy service, not the orchestrator we wanted to study.

\subsection*{Moments that changed the trajectory}
The pivotal moment came during Lecture~6 when a guest NGO described how hard it is to scope student projects without hand-holding. That story made us revisit our own campus experience and birthed SkillSync: a student--organisation matchmaking platform focused on scoped, time-bound collaborations. We mapped the new interaction using the platform design toolkit from \citet{Reillier2017}, prototyped scoping templates in Figma, and ran hallway tests with five NGOs from previous course projects. Another turning point was analysing monetisation for the home-chef idea. The numbers crumbled under \citet{Porter2008}'s competitive pressure, yet the same analytical exercise illuminated how SkillSync could monetise through completion-based fees and partner enablement. The pivot looked dramatic on paper, but in practice it was a sequence of incremental bets guided by data and theory, echoing the cautionary tales from Lecture~6 about platforms that misread winner-take-all dynamics \citep{Lecture06}. One example of such a bet was running a two-week concierge test where we manually matched three student teams to NGO briefs to validate workflow pain points before investing in automation.

\subsection*{Reflection on the path taken}
Was sticking with SkillSync the optimal play? Mostly yes. The concept matches our comparative advantage (campus networks plus student-consulting experience) and gives us a clean cross-side interaction to analyse. We did move too slowly on validating willingness to pay. If I could rewind, I would run pricing conversations alongside prototyping instead of waiting for a polished deck. \citet{HagiuWright2013} warn that deferring business-model validation makes pivots harder later, and I would keep a thinner backlog so sunk-cost bias pops sooner.

Figure~\ref{fig:project-creation} grounds the pivot: the organisation-side wizard forces clarity on outcomes, timelines, support assets, and evaluation criteria with helper text so NGOs feel coached rather than interrogated. During testing a volunteer coordinator realised she could reuse survey questions as project milestones.

Figure~\ref{fig:project-creation} converts NGO ideas into platform-ready briefs.

The expanded scope also let us document decision hygiene. Fortnightly retros scored each experiment on desirability, feasibility, and viability; when the food marketplace kept ranking low on feasibility the notes justified the pivot, while SkillSync experiments stayed attractive thanks to campus networks. The rituals operationalised \citet{Choudary2016}'s iterative governance and \citet{Srnicek2017}'s legitimacy checks.
