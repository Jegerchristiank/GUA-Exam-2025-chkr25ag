\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
This bundle is the polished take-home exam for Google, Uber, Amazon. Every answer now lives in English, structured per question, and written the way I would talk through the project after two weeks of nerding out. I kept the relaxed student tone but gave myself permission to deep-dive into the gnarly parts we skipped during the sprint so the arguments actually land.

I also rebuilt the submission workflow around traceability. After each major revision I run `texcount -char -sum -merge main.tex` to track the live character count and update the cover page macro. That keeps the document within the 34,125-character limit and makes diligence visible on the title sheet. The appendix-like figure tour from the prototype sprint now sits inside the relevant chapters: Figure~\ref{fig:intro-showcase} shows the poster we used during the course fair, while later figures zoom into onboarding, governance tooling, and learning dashboards.

Finally, the introduction doubles as a promise: each assignment explains how the SkillSync platform matured, why the design choices follow platform theory, and which artefacts back the claims. The write-up cross-references the dataset of Figma screens, weekly reflections, and cases from \citet{Choudary2016}, \citet{Srnicek2017}, \citet{Reillier2017}, and the rest of the syllabus so no section leans on vague vibes.
